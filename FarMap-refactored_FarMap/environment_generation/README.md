# Environments

## Map Generation
`python generator.py`

This code only generate environment without scaling and colorization although we include related function in the code.
We randomly colorize on every trial when we run the experiment with five random seeds.

## Environment Examples
We attach examples of colorized environments in `environments/`.
Note that, the size of each colored square is 3x3 (we scale up the environment by factor of 3).
